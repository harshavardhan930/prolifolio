            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                I am a passionate Engineer with a degree in Electrical Electronics Engineering. My very first experience
with code was at the time when I started my own blog. My struggle to customize the blog pages
introduced me to HTML & CSS. Sooner, the excitment of having the power to structure pages on
my own sounded amazing and that’s when I decided to purse Web development.Recently, I learnt
Full Stack Development. I have knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, Java, C++ and Data Structures.
Rational thought process and goal-oriented planning are my strengths.I am currently on the look out
for a challenging role to build products that make a difference.
